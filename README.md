===============
Jerry's Cryptography and AJAX javascript and PHP Library

Ubiquitous Robust Encryption.  Any web page can easily employ robust encryption.  No SSL, no secure server needed. javascript and PHP function library does everything, even client to server URL encoding automatically.  RC4 over RSA really is just this easy 

js: <body onload= initCrypto( 1024 bit)

js: encryptToServer( clientPlainText)

PHP: decryptFromClient( encryptedDataFromClient)

PHP: encryptToClient( serverPlainText)

js: decryptFromServer( encryptedDataFromServer)

Encrypt everything on the Internet from mobile device web apps to dinner recipe web pages. The technology is now free.

Encrypting only important documents merely identifies which documents are important, attracting the most powerful decryption efforts. Which is better? A society in which no one can have any secrets? Or a society in which anyone can keep everything secret?
